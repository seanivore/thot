# Project Name Architecture Overview
`project.website-if-applicable.com`

**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Version**: v1.0.0
**Status**: Status of project — note **shipped** vs **spec-only** when relevant (e.g., "v3 shipped; v4 in active build; v5 spec-only in IMPLEMENT")

---

## Executive Summary 

  + **Purpose**: this document provides everything a new AI instance needs to understand and work on this project effectively; it also serves as comprehensive technical documentation
  + **Use**: read this first before making any changes; update it after non-trivial changes ship

---

## How This Doc Relates to IMPLEMENT.md

`PROJECT_NAME.md` is the **living architecture/state doc** — what *is* true about the project right now. The current `vX_Y_Z_IMPLEMENT.md` in `docs/archive/vX_Y/` is the **living roadmap** — what's coming next, in detail.

The two play different roles:

  + **PROJECT_NAME.md** holds finalized architecture, the design system, file-structure references, common pitfalls, and the strategic roadmap *summary* (milestone-level only). Reference content lives here so IMPLEMENT and BUILD docs don't have to repeat it.
  + **`vX_Y_Z_IMPLEMENT.md`** holds the active per-milestone detail. As chunks are promoted to BUILD and ship, the corresponding section in IMPLEMENT is condensed and the architectural detail migrates into PROJECT_NAME.md.

This means PROJECT_NAME.md grows over time as the project ships, and IMPLEMENT.md stays focused on what's still ahead. If you find a fact in PROJECT_NAME.md that contradicts the current IMPLEMENT, IMPLEMENT wins (PROJECT_NAME was likely not yet updated). If a past version's IMPLEMENT contradicts PROJECT_NAME.md, PROJECT_NAME.md wins (past IMPLEMENTs are frozen). See `.agent/DEV_RULES.md` § *Master Documents* for the full conflict resolution rule.

**Notation convention**: when a section describes work that's spec-only (planned but not yet shipped), prefix it with **`[spec-only]`**. When it describes shipped behavior, no prefix needed. This keeps a future agent from acting on a planned-but-not-implemented architectural decision.

## Strategic Roadmap

Milestone-level orientation only. Detailed plans for each milestone live in `docs/archive/vX_Y/vX_Y_Z_IMPLEMENT.md` (the highest-numbered version is the active living roadmap). This section exists so any agent can see the milestone shape without reading the full archive.

### Public Release Line

[If the project has a "first public release" pin — e.g., "Does not ship publicly until vX.0.0 because feature Y is the prerequisite" — state it here. Otherwise remove this subsection.]

### Milestones

| Version   | Theme                          | Ship to            | Status                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **vX.x**  | What this milestone is about   | Internal / Public  | In flight / Planned / Spec-only     |
| **vY.0**  | What this milestone is about   | Public / Soft launch | Research / Planned                |
| **vNext** | Strategy phase, not promised   | TBD                | Strategy phase                      |

### vX.x — [milestone name]

[One-paragraph framing. Then bullets for each minor or patch under this milestone, with a short sentence and a pointer to the IMPLEMENT/BUILD detail.]

- **vX.0.0** (current/shipped/spec-only) — what this version does. Spec: `docs/archive/vX_Y/vX_Y_Z_IMPLEMENT.md` § [section].
- **vX.1.0** — what this version does. Spec: [path].

### Roadmap rules of thumb

- **One IMPLEMENT.md per version** — this section names versions; details live there.
- **Research before promotion** — anything in vNext stays in `docs/research/` until a `final_recommendations.md` closes the bucket.
- **Don't read this section during execution** — the active BUILD or IMPLEMENT is the source of truth for what to build *now*. This section is for orientation.

## Development Philosophy

### "Exclusively Executable Plan" Approach

**Core Principle**: Understand everything upfront, resolve unknowns before coding, create complete plan before execution.

**Why This Works**:
- AI can generate 20 files in minutes (old process would take days)
- But AI can also generate 20 WRONG files in minutes
- Planning prevents wrong files
- Planning is faster than debugging wrong code

**Process**:
1. Understand the full system
2. Plan every detail upfront
3. Identify unknowns and resolve them
4. Write complete, correct code
5. Test once, it works

**Benefits**:
- Front-load the thinking, back-load the execution
- Avoid debugging nightmare
- Write fresh code with confidence
- No "unknown unknowns" hiding in old code

### Planning vs Debugging

**Old Development Process** (Debugging-Heavy):
  1. Write code
  2. Test it
  3. Find bugs
  4. Fix bugs one by one
  5. Repeat until it works
  6. **Problem**: Each bug blocks testing, takes hours/days

**Modern AI-Assisted Process** (Planning-Heavy):
  1. Understand the full system
  2. Plan every detail upfront
  3. Identify unknowns and resolve them
  4. Write complete, correct code
  5. Test once, it works
  6. **Benefit**: Front-load the thinking, back-load the execution

### Rewriting vs Patching

**Previous Agent's Work**:
  - ❌ Didn't understand Vercel until the end
  - ❌ Converted to React without full understanding
  - ❌ Made assumptions that were wrong
  - ❌ Left broken code expecting us to fix it

**Our Approach**:
  - ✅ Full understanding before coding
  - ✅ Complete plan before execution
  - ✅ Write fresh code with confidence
  - ✅ Test after everything works

**Why This is Better**:
  - If we need full understanding to fix bugs, we need it to write code anyway
  - Writing fresh code is faster than debugging broken code
  - We'll have confidence it's correct
  - No "unknown unknowns" hiding in old code

## Deployment

### Build Process

  ```bash
  # Commands to build for production
  [build commands]
  ```

### Hosting Configuration

  + **Platform**: GitHub Pages / Vercel / etc.
  + **Build source**: Branch or directory
  + **Custom domain**: `domain-if-applicable.com`

### CI/CD Notes

  + Workflow or action notes
  + Environment variables needed

### Post-Deploy Verification

  1. Check specific functionality
  2. Verify critical path
  3. Test edge case
